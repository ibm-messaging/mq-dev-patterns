# IBM MQ JMS samples
The JMS samples are based on the the existing samples shipped with IBM MQ Server and Client packages.
These have been tested with Eclipse OpenJ9 VM 11.0.17.0


Download
[latest IBM MQ allclient jar](https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:com.ibm.mq.allclient)

[JMS API 2.0.1 jar](https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:javax.jms-api)

[JSON parser](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.json/json/20230227)

Add the jars to the top level JMS folder, these commands will then work

## Jakarta
If you want to use Jakarta Messaging in place of JMS, then use the following jars in-lieu of allclient and jms-api.

 [latest IBM MQ Jakarta client jar](https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:com.ibm.mq.jakarta.client)

[Jakarta Messaging API 2.0.1 jar](https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:jakarta.jms-api)

This will generate compilation errors. The code, however contains commented out blocks (mainly the import blocks) that you can uncomment to overcome the compilation errors. Remember to remove the JMS code blocks that need removing.

If you are using maven then add -P JAKARTA to the mvn commands.
eg.
```
mvn clean package -P JAKARTA
```

Alternatively a Jakarta enabled `pom-jakarta.xml` can be used.


## Intro to JMS Samples

### Stand alone JMS samples

**ConversationSharingTest.java** - Creates and closes two JMSContexts and sleeps after each call, to give time to check  
                                   how many conversations have been started with the queue manager.

**JmsPut.java** - Puts message to a queue

**JmsGet.java** - Gets message from a queue

**JmsSub.java** - Subscribes to a topic string and gets publications/messages

**JmsPub.java** - Publishes messages to a topic string

**JmsRequest.java** - Puts a message on a request queue and waits for a response

**JmsResponse.java** - Gets message from a request queue, does something with the message and puts it to the reply queue.

**RequestCalc.java** - Builds string for message for JmsRequest, does the calculation for the JmsResponse.

**SampleEnvSetter.java** - Used by all stand alone samples to read the variable from the env.json. Used by the decoupled samples through the ConnectionHelper.
Encapsulates the reading of MQ environment variables and allows all the samples to use a common set.

The location and name of the env.json file defaults
to `../env.json`. This can be overriden by setting the environment option `EnvFile`.

eg.

````
java -DEnvFile=../env.json -jar target/mq-dev-patterns-0.1.0.jar put
````
If the environment settings file isn't found then the CCDT, Queue Manager, Queue, and user credentials need to be provided as environment settings.

````
java -DEnvFile=../env-not-found.json -DQMGR=QM1 -DAPP_USER=app -DAPP_PASSWORD=app-passw0rd -DQUEUE_NAME=DEV.QUEUE.1 -DMQCCDTURL=file:///location/ccdt.json -jar target/mq-dev-patterns-0.1.0.jar put
````

### Refactored samples to reduce duplication

***BasicConsumer.java*** - Common class to receive messages and publications

**BasicGet.java** - Gets messages from a queue

**BasicSub.java** - Subscribes to messages from a topic

***BasicProducer.java*** - Common class to send messages and publications

**BasicPut.java** - Puts messages onto a queue

**BasicPub.java** - Publishes messages to a topic

**Helper Classes**

***ConnectionHelper.java*** - Manages the connection to MQ

***ConsumerHelper.java*** - Common class to act on received messages

***LoggingHelper.java*** - Common class to set up logging options

## Maven
A maven `pom.xml` is provided allowing you to use maven to download dependancies and build the samples. A symbolic link links the maven required `./src/main/java/com` directory to the `./com` directory.

### Downloading dependencies with maven
Whenever you build the samples with maven the dependencies will be downloaded and stored in your local maven repository. You can override this location, but by
default the repository location will be:

- Windows: C:\Users\<User_Name>\.m2\repository
- Linux: /home/<User_Name>/.m2/repository
- Mac: /Users/<user_name>/.m2/repository

The maven build has been configured to create an uber jar containing all dependencies, but if you need the jar files in a more convenient location you can run the maven command:

````
mvn dependency:copy-dependencies -DoutputDirectory=.
````
Which will download and copy the dependencies into the current directory.


### Building and running the samples on windows

If you are using a Windows machine and wish to use maven to build these samples , the symbolic link between the `./src/main/java/com` and `./com` directory needs to be repaired.
Navigate to `src/main/java` and run the following command to remove existing com file.
````
del com
````
To create a symbolic link between `./src/main/java/com` and `./com` use the following command.
````
mklink /J com ..\..\..\com
````
If you are running the samples on a Windows machine , the classpath separator needs to be `;` and not `:`.
eg.
````
javac -cp ./com.ibm.mq.allclient-9.2.5.0.jar:./javax.jms-api-2.0.1.jar:./json-20230227.jar:. com/ibm/mq/samples/jms/JmsPut.java
````
will cause an error on windows, and needs to be:
````
javac -cp ./com.ibm.mq.allclient-9.2.5.0.jar;./javax.jms-api-2.0.1.jar;./json-20230227.jar;. com/ibm/mq/samples/jms/JmsPut.java
````
### Building the samples with maven

You can build the samples by running the command.

````
mvn clean package
````

If you want to use the Jakarta messaging dependencies then run
either

````
mvn clean package -P JAKARTA
````

or

````
mvn clean package -f pom-jakarta.xml
````

The `clean` option will clear out any previous build.
The build will create a ./target/mq-dev-patterns-0.1.0.jar file containing the
compiled samples.

The package phase in the `pom.xml` includes `maven-shade-plugin` which will
create an uber `.jar` file containing all dependencies.

If you use maven to build the samples, you will not need to compile them separately.


### Running maven built samples.
The main class in the uber jar is `com.ibm.mq.samples.jms.BasicSampleDriver`, which will run the basic put / get and pub / sub samples.

To put 6 messages run:
````
java -jar target/mq-dev-patterns-0.1.0.jar put 6
````

To get the messages run:
````
java -jar target/mq-dev-patterns-0.1.0.jar get
````

To publish 5 messages run:
````
java -jar target/mq-dev-patterns-0.1.0.jar pub 5
````

To subscribe run:
````
java -jar target/mq-dev-patterns-0.1.0.jar sub
````

To run any of the samples you can specify the `.jar` file as the classpath.
EG. To run the JmsPut sample:

````
java -cp target/mq-dev-patterns-0.1.0.jar com.ibm.mq.samples.jms.JmsPut
````


## Put / Get
From the top level JMS folder, compile first

`javac -cp ./com.ibm.mq.allclient-9.2.5.0.jar:./javax.jms-api-2.0.1.jar:./json-20230227.jar:. com/ibm/mq/samples/jms/JmsPut.java`

and run

`java -cp ./com.ibm.mq.allclient-9.2.5.0.jar:./javax.jms-api-2.0.1.jar:./json-20230227.jar:. com.ibm.mq.samples.jms.JmsPut`

If you have used maven to build the samples, you can run

`java -cp target/mq-dev-patterns-0.1.0.jar: com.ibm.mq.samples.jms.JmsPut`


In a separate terminal, from the top level JMS folder, compile first

`javac -cp ./com.ibm.mq.allclient-9.2.5.0.jar:./javax.jms-api-2.0.1.jar:./json-20230227.jar:. com/ibm/mq/samples/jms/JmsGet.java`

and run

`java -cp ./com.ibm.mq.allclient-9.2.5.0.jar:./javax.jms-api-2.0.1.jar:./json-20230227.jar:. com.ibm.mq.samples.jms.JmsGet`

If you have used maven to build the samples, you can run

`java -cp target/mq-dev-patterns-0.1.0.jar com.ibm.mq.samples.jms.JmsGet`

## Publish / Subscribe
Open two terminals.

In the first terminal;

You have to run the subscriber sample first so it creates a subscription and waits for a publication.

Compile first

`javac -cp ./com.ibm.mq.allclient-9.2.5.0.jar:./javax.jms-api-2.0.1.jar:./json-20230227.jar:. com/ibm/mq/samples/jms/JmsSub.java`

then run

`java -cp ./com.ibm.mq.allclient-9.2.5.0.jar:./javax.jms-api-2.0.1.jar:./json-20230227.jar:. com.ibm.mq.samples.jms.JmsSub`

If you have used maven to build the samples, you can run

`java -cp target/mq-dev-patterns-0.1.0.jar com.ibm.mq.samples.jms.JmsSub`

In the second terminal;

Run the publisher sample

Compile first

`javac -cp ./com.ibm.mq.allclient-9.2.5.0.jar:./javax.jms-api-2.0.1.jar:./json-20230227.jar:. com/ibm/mq/samples/jms/JmsPub.java`

then run

`java -cp ./com.ibm.mq.allclient-9.2.5.0.jar:./javax.jms-api-2.0.1.jar:./json-20230227.jar:. com.ibm.mq.samples.jms.JmsPub`

If you have used maven to build the samples, you can run

`java -cp target/mq-dev-patterns-0.1.0.jar com.ibm.mq.samples.jms.JmsPub`

## Request / Response
Open two terminals.

In the first terminal;

Run the request sample

Compile

`javac -cp ./com.ibm.mq.allclient-9.2.5.0.jar:./javax.jms-api-2.0.1.jar:./json-20230227.jar:. com/ibm/mq/samples/jms/JmsRequest.java`

then run

`java -cp ./com.ibm.mq.allclient-9.2.5.0.jar:./javax.jms-api-2.0.1.jar:./json-20230227.jar:. com.ibm.mq.samples.jms.JmsRequest`


If you have used maven to build the samples, you can run

`java -cp target/mq-dev-patterns-0.1.0.jar com.ibm.mq.samples.jms.JmsRequest`

The request sample will put a message and wait for a response until it either gets a response or you `ctrl+c` interrupt it.

If you set the environment variable `REPLY_QUEUE_NAME` then the reply to queue will be set
to that queue, otherwise a temporary queue is created.

In the second terminal;

Run the response sample

Compile first

`javac -cp ./com.ibm.mq.allclient-9.2.5.0.jar:./javax.jms-api-2.0.1.jar:./json-20230227.jar:. com/ibm/mq/samples/jms/JmsResponse.java`

and run

`java -cp ./com.ibm.mq.allclient-9.2.5.0.jar:./javax.jms-api-2.0.1.jar:./json-20230227.jar:. com.ibm.mq.samples.jms.JmsResponse`

If you have used maven to build the samples, you can run

`java -cp target/mq-dev-patterns-0.1.0.jar com.ibm.mq.samples.jms.JmsResponse`

The response sample will get a message from the queue, process it and put the response on the reply to queue and keep looking for more messages to respond to till you ctrl+c interrupt it.

If you set the environment variable `RESPONDER_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT` to a number the responder will wait `RESPONDER_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT` seconds for a request before timing out and ending.

If you set the environment variable `REQUEST_MESSAGE_EXPIRY` to a number the requester will set the message expiry to  `REQUEST_MESSAGE_EXPIRY` seconds. It will then wait for `REQUEST_MESSAGE_EXPIRY` seconds for a reply before timing out and ending.


## The SampleEnvSetter

Used by all samples to read the JSON file. Will be compiled when you compile any other the other samples.


## The RequestResponseHelper

Used in the request / response samples to parse messages into and out of JSON.
Will be compiled when you compile either request / response samples.

The message content to be posted can be controlled by the envionment option `REQUEST_MODE`.

EG.

`java -DREQUEST_MODE="REWARDS" -cp target/mq-dev-patterns-0.1.0.jar com.ibm.mq.samples.jms.JmsRequest`

A `REQUEST_MODE` of `REWARDS` sends messages posting reward points to a customer id.
Any other value for `REQUEST_MODE` runs in default mode where the request sends a
random number, which is squared and returned in the response.


## scripts/multi-jms-sample-driver.sh

The `scripts` folder contains the `multi-jms-sample-driver.sh` script which enables you to run multiple instances of a JMS application.
By default, the script will run 6 instances of `JmsGet.java`. To change this you can supply the application class name and the number of instances when you run the script as below from the `scripts` folder

`./multi-jms-sample-driver.sh <jms_application_class_name> <number_of_instances>`

The script will run with the defaults if these values aren't specified.

You can also export a CCDT for the JMS application to use as below

`export MQCCDTURL=file:///<your_CCDT_file>`

The classpath specified will depend on whether or not maven was used to build the samples - uncomment the relevent one within the script (classpath for maven is the default)

If you are on a Windows machine and wish to run this script , then you can make use of [WSL (Windows Subsystem For Linux)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). This script has been tested on Ubuntu Distribution in WSL, feel free to use any other linux distribution. Since you might have edited the script using a windows text editor , the endline formatting needs to be changed to avoid bad interpreter exception. Use the following commands in WSL :

`sudo apt install dos2unix`

`dos2unix ./multi-jms-sample-driver.sh`

You can now run the script using the command mentioned above.

## Run the samples with TLS

To run the samples with TLS you need to provide additional arguments;

`java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=jks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/your_key_directory/clientkey.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=<your_keystore_pw> -Dcom.ibm.mq.cfg.useIBMCipherMappings=false -cp ./com.ibm.mq.allclient-9.2.5.0.jar:./javax.jms-api-2.0.1.jar:./json-20230227.jar:. com.ibm.mq.samples.jms.JmsPut`

 *A note on the* `Dcom.ibm.mq.cfg.useIBMCipherMappings=false` property

This is needed as the samples were tested in an enviroment with the Oracle JRE installed. Depending on whether you have Oracle or IBM JRE installed, you also need to name the cipher suite/spec accordingly. See the table here [TLS CipherSpecs and CipherSuites in IBM MQ classes for JMS](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_9.1.0/com.ibm.mq.dev.doc/q113220_.htm)

## Bindings mode

By default these samples will run in client mode. If you do want to run the samples in `bindings` mode, then add

````
    "BINDINGS": true
````

to the `env.json` file.

## Unit Test
The samples also contain unit tests in `src/test`. These tests require connection with a Queue Manager and use the default `env.json` present in the repository, hence make sure you have at least one valid endpoint in the `env.json`.

To run these tests, Use the following command:

````
mvn test
````

NOTE : If you are on a windows machine make sure you have the symbolic link between `./src/main/java/com` and `./com` as mentioned above.
